          I’m an Offensive Security Consultant specializing in red teaming, adversary simulation, and vulnerability assessments across cloud, on-prem, and hybrid infrastructures. I help organizations understand how real attackers operate by replicating their techniques in controlled environments.

        <p>
          My work spans technical exploitation, social engineering, phishing simulations, and threat exposure assessments across industries including BFSI, healthcare, and logistics. I focus on clearly communicating exploitation paths and remediation priorities to both technical teams and executive stakeholders.

          Beyond offensive operations, I conduct security webinars, develop training material, and publish technical write-ups on exploitation techniques, case studies, and vulnerability research. My goal is to turn real-world attack behavior into practical guidance that helps organizations meaningfully improve their security posture.
