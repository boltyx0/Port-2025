          I work as a Security Consultant with a strong focus on offensive security, red teaming, and adversary simulation. My work is grounded in understanding how real attacks happen and using that insight to help organizations make informed, practical security decisions.

        <p>
          A significant part of my role involves working closely with customers and internal teams running security assessments, supporting proof-of-concepts, evaluating security tools, and clearly communicating technical findings to both engineering teams and business stakeholders. I also collaborate with vendor partners and regional teams to integrate new security products, support technical enablement, and contribute to post-engagement strategy discussions.

          Alongside hands-on security work, I spend time researching threats, analyzing security incidents, and running phishing simulations and awareness initiatives. I write blogs about security issues, attack techniques, and real-world findings, and I work on training material and webinars to help teams better understand risks and improve their overall security posture.
